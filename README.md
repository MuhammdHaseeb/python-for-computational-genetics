# 🐍 Python Learning Project

Welcome to my Python learning repository! This project is part of my journey to master Python programming, and it's structured to help beginners set up and manage their own Python projects effectively.

---

## 📌 About the Project

This repository includes basic Python programs, exercises, and project setups. It also serves as a template for managing Python environments and packages using best practices like virtual environments and \`requirements.txt\`.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Easy-to-follow project setup guide
- Virtual environment management
- Package installation using pip
- Auto-generated requirements file
- Beginner-friendly structure

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up this project on your local machine:

---

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

---

### 📥 Clone the Repository

1. Open **VS Code** or **Terminal / Command Prompt**.
2. Navigate to the folder where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
\`\`\`

---

### 🐍 Set Up Python Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment:

\`\`\`bash
python -m venv venv
\`\`\`

#### ▶️ Activate the virtual environment:

- **On Windows:**
  \`\`\`bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  \`\`\`
- **On macOS/Linux:**
  \`\`\`bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  \`\`\`

---

### 📦 Install Required Packages

Install essential Python packages:

\`\`\`bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib biopython jupyter
\`\`\`

---

### 📄 Freeze Installed Libraries

Save the list of installed packages:

\`\`\`bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
\`\`\`

> This file ensures reproducibility for future setups.

---

### 🔄 Reinstall from \`requirements.txt\`

To install all saved packages on another system or later:

\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Managing your Python project with virtual environments and \`requirements.txt\` ensures:
- Clean and isolated environments
- Easy sharing and collaboration
- Reliable reproduction of results
