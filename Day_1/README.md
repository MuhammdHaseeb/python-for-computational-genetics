# Programming Fundamentals

## What is Programming?

Programming is the art of writing instructions for a computer to execute, telling it **what to do**, **how to do it**, and **when to do it**. These instructions are written in a programming language, such as Python.

## What is Python?

Python was created in the late 1980s by **Guido van Rossum**. It has three key characteristics that make it a versatile and powerful tool:

1. **Interpreted Language:**  
   Python code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter. This differs from compiled languages like C++ or Java, where the entire code is converted into machine code before execution. Python’s interpreted nature allows you to run your code and see results instantly without a separate compilation step.

2. **High-Level Language:**  
   Python abstracts away many low-level details, allowing you to focus on programming logic rather than hardware specifics. It simplifies complex tasks, making the code easier to read, write, and maintain.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**  
   OOP organizes code around **objects**, which are data structures containing both data and functions. This promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability, making it easier to manage and scale large projects.

### Python Libraries

Python comes with many built-in libraries, such as:

- **NumPy:** Numerical computations  
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis  
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning algorithms  

These libraries, combined with Python’s clear syntax, enable powerful data analysis, predictive modeling, and AI development.

### What is a Variable?

A **variable** is like a container that stores data in a computer’s memory. Variables allow you to assign names to values, making it easier to reference and manipulate them throughout your program. This makes your code more organized, readable, and easier to modify.

---

### What is a Data Type?

A **data type** defines the kind of data a variable can hold. Common Python data types include:

- **Integers:** Whole numbers like `0`, `1`, `-2`  
- **Floating-point numbers:** Numbers with decimals like `2.45`, `-0.6`  
- **Strings:** Text enclosed in quotes like `"hello"`, `'hi'`  
- **Booleans:** Represent `True` or `False` values  

Using the correct data type ensures your code behaves as expected and helps prevent errors.

### What are Operators?

**Operators** are symbols that perform operations on data. They allow you to manipulate and transform data.

- **Arithmetic Operators:** `+` (add), `-` (subtract), `*` (multiply), `/` (divide)

---

### What are Comparison Operators?

**Comparison operators** compare values and return boolean results:

- `>` (greater than)  
- `<` (less than)  
- `==` (equal to)  
- `!=` (not equal to)  
- `>=` (greater than or equal to)  
- `<=` (less than or equal to)

---

### What are Logical Operators?

Logical operators combine boolean expressions:

- **AND**: True if both conditions are true  
- **OR**: True if at least one condition is true  
- **NOT**: Negates the condition  

Example: `shape is blue AND triangular`

---

### What are Control Flow Statements?

Control flow statements determine the order in which your code executes. They let you create branches and loops:

- **Conditional Statements:** `if`, `elif`, `else` — execute code based on conditions  
- **Loops:** Repeat blocks of code multiple times (`for`, `while` loops)  

These statements enable your program to make decisions and respond to different situations.

---

### What are Functions?

**Functions** are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They:

- Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable units  
- Help organize code and improve readability  
- Avoid redundancy by allowing you to reuse code  

You write a function once and can call it multiple times wherever needed.

Programming fundamentals help you **break down problems** logically and solve them step-by-step. In Python, you use variables to store data, loops to iterate through datasets, conditional statements to make decisions, functions to encapsulate reusable logic, and libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
